# Now<em>News</em>Today

Russian hackers, clickbait, blatantly false information - now is the time to join the bandwagon and monopolize on fake news. I propose a unique way to exploit social media and track susceptibility, at least with this small trap website. Share articles and catch your friends in their sensational reactions to fake news that you share with them. Share news links, see the usage of your link and how far your friends went to verify the content of the news you share.

This app's primary purpose was to allow me the opportunity to work with complex datatypes in a full stack app.
