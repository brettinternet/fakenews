# Now<em>News</em>Today

Russian hackers, clickbait, blatantly false information - now is the time to join the bandwagon and monopolize on fake news. I propose a unique way to exploit social media and track susceptibility, at least with this small trap website. Share articles and catch your friends in their sensational reactions to fake news that you share with them. Share news links, see the usage of your link and how far your friends went to verify the content of the news you share.

This app's primary purpose was to allow me the opportunity to work with complex datatypes in a full stack app.

I'm redoing this app with React along with a few other scaleable features:

- ImmutableJS
- multilingual with React-Intl
- sagas
- generators
- selectors with Reselect
- production and dev environments with Webpack
- highly automated data collection with NodeJS for aggregating articles
- extensive REST API use to Google Maps API, IBM Watson API, and Clarifai image API to enhance article data
- Redux
- Styled Components
- custom meta tags and social media ready with Helmet
- fast compiling with Webpack DLL
- custom node logger ready for PM2

Additionally, I've tried to follow the code styling guide established by [Airbnb's developer's here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).
